## Overview

This was a small project that allows you to preview your message before you send it in UC posts. This is great if you are using syntax highlighting or fancy bbcode tricks (like those at https://bbcode.getneptune.tech).

- Supports Smilie previewing and autofill
- Supports all basic BBCode Text options
- Supports Code Block Syntax Highlighting
- Built into the HTML of UC
- Lightweight (uses tampermonkey)

## How to use

1. Install the Tampermonkey Extension into your browser
2. Copy the contents of the script or download it
3. Paste it into a new script on tampermonkey

Or, visit the official [GreasyFork]() page to install it in one click.
